# vocabularyApp
Is just an app I created to start using the lastest updates in Android 6.0 

Some of the issues I found are listed under my Google+ profile. 

Right now it's a bit stop since I need to work more on my website. Yet, you can find here some classes to connect to a website using the lastest changes in HTTP connection and a couple of fragments with their connection with the main activity. 

The UI is pretty basic without much attention on the layouts' style.
